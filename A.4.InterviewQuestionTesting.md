## Agile Development
Relies on frequent collaboration and communication refered as Agile Cerimonies
- **Sprint Planning**
    Product owner prioritizes the backlog,
    Team Selects backlog items to work on,
    Define Sprint
- **Daily Stand Up**
    Developer Team - What is completed yesterday, today, Do I have any Bloackages?
- **Sprint Reviews**
    Showcase Completed Work
    Stakeholder Feedback
- **Sprint Retrospect**
    - Reflect on sprint and improve process what went well,
    - what didn't go well
    - What can we improve
- **Back Refinement**
    - Prepare backlog for future sprints
    - Prioritize and clarity user stories
    - Break large stoeies into smaller teasks
- Release Planning
- Story Kickoff
- Bug Triage
- Spike Discussion

## Agile Methodologies 
  - Scurm - Iterative sprints
  - Kanban - Countinous Delivery with a visual board
  - XP - Extreame programming, frequent releases
  - Lean - Optimizing resources, reducing waste

## Reporting a bug
  - Bug's Title
  - a clear description of the problem
  - steps to reproduce it
  - The Expected Result
  - The Actual Result 

## Roles of Tester in Agile
  - Work closely with dev to understand requirements 
  - Countinously test during dev
  - Automate test where possible 
  - Participate in psrint cremonies
  - Ensure quick feedback to developers

## User Stories
  - A small functionsal requirement written from user's perspective
  - Example
    - As a user, I want to rest my password so that I can regain account access

## Acceptance Criteria
  - Conditions that must be met for the story to be considered completed

## Verification
  - Ensure the product is being built correctly 
  - Meets Design Specification
  - eg
    - Code reviews
    - Static analysis
    - walk through
    - inspection

## Validation
  - Ensures the right prouct is being built
    - Functional testing
    - UAT
    - Executing the code

## Regression testing
  - Ensures the recent changes in the code base do not negatively impact ehe existing functionality 
  - It is performed after bug fix, updates, or enhancement.

## Black box testing
- Does not need the knowledge of the internal code structure
- Focuses on input and output
